    /* SupplyHandler passes a handler which will be "returned" via a
       matching call to handler->ProcessItem. Multiple handlers may be
       outstanding at a given time. The channel blocks when there are
       no handlers available, so this is the primary flow control
       mechanism to allow the reader to exert back-pressure on a
       channel.

       If the channel has not been started or has delivered a
       termination item to the application since the last call to
       Start, handler->ProcessItem will be called with value NULL on
       the calling thread before SupplyHandler returns.

       If there is an item waiting to be delivered and handler is an
       RChannelItemReaderHandlerImmediate then handler will be called
       back with the item on the calling thread before SupplyHandler
       returns.

       If handler is an RChannelItemReaderHandlerQueued it will never
       be called back on the calling thread. If there is an item
       waiting to be delivered, a processing request will be queued
       for the item with handler, otherwise handler will be queued
       waiting for the next item to be ready.

       If thread B submits an RChannelItemReaderHandlerImmediate with
       a call to SupplyHandler that is overlapped with thread A's call
       to SupplyHandler, B's immediate handler may be called on A's
       calling thread before A's call to SupplyHandler returns.

       After a handler has been submitted to SupplyHandler with a
       given value of cancelCookie, that handler is guaranteed to be
       returned before any matching call to Cancel with the same value
       of cancelCookie returns. If there is no item available at the
       time the handler is cancelled it will be called with
       NULL. cancelCookie may take any value, including NULL, however
       it is safest to use NULL or the address of an object owned by
       the caller. The cancellation mechanism is used internally by
       the synchronous FetchNextItem call which uses an allocated heap
       address as its cancelCookie. Using the heap address of an
       object which has not been freed before the call to Cancel will
       avoid any danger of a cookie collision.

       For any item A which has already been returned via an async
       handler or call to FetchNextItem when SupplyHandler is called
       it is guaranteed that A's sequence number is less than or equal
       to the sequence number of the item eventually returned on
       handler. Beyond this constraint, if multiple handlers are
       outstanding at once, or while calls to FetchNextItem are in
       progress, the order of delivered items is undefined.

       If the timeout expires FetchNextItem returns false and *outItem
       is NULL. Otherwise FetchNextItem returns true and the returned
       item is stored in *outItem. *outItem may be NULL even if
